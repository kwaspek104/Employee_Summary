# Employee Summary

## Description
Hello there and welcome to my humble but effective Employee Summary Generator! Need a way to conveniently list all of your employee's info onto a web page? Look no further than this! Just simply type in "node app.js" in the terminal and answer all of the questions. After that, there should be an html in the output folder. 

Happy Holidays!

## Installation
Simply clone this repo to your local machine.

## Usage
This is used to generate a readme whenever you want. This video should also help, as it demonstrates how to use the application: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RUnDt9MZ_quV3ghfPBiZMw0KIE31h7Qw/view

## Tests
Run "npm run test" in the console. If it doesn't work initially, it may be because it had to create a "Develop" folder. Run "npm run test" again and it should work.
